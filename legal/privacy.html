    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="updated">Last updated: December 2024</p>

    <p>Kwanzaa Pocket Guide ("we", "our", or "the app") is committed to protecting your privacy. This policy explains what information we collect and how it is used.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    
    <h3>Automatically Generated Data</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Device Identity:</strong> When you first use the Community Board, the app generates a cryptographic keypair (public/private key) stored locally on your device. This keypair is used to sign your posts and verify your identity. The private key never leaves your device.</li>
        <li><strong>Display Name:</strong> You may optionally set a display name. If not set, a random identifier is generated from your public key.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>User-Generated Content</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Community Posts:</strong> Messages you post to the Community Board are shared publicly with other users via a peer-to-peer (P2P) network.</li>
        <li><strong>Journal Entries:</strong> Personal journal entries are stored locally on your device only and are never transmitted.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Information We Do NOT Collect</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Real name or contact information</li>
        <li>Location data</li>
        <li>Device identifiers (IDFA, Android ID)</li>
        <li>Usage analytics or tracking data</li>
        <li>Payment information</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How Your Data is Shared</h2>
    
    <p>The Community Board uses <strong>Gun.js</strong>, a decentralized peer-to-peer database. When you post to the Community Board:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your post, display name, and public key are shared with all users of the app</li>
        <li>Data syncs directly between devices and through relay servers</li>
        <li>Posts are public and cannot be made private</li>
        <li>We do not control or have access to the P2P network data</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Local Storage:</strong> Your keypair, display name, journal entries, blocked users, and hidden posts are stored locally on your device.</li>
        <li><strong>P2P Network:</strong> Community posts are distributed across the decentralized Gun.js network and may persist indefinitely on other users' devices.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Deletion</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Local Data:</strong> Uninstall the app or clear app data to remove all locally stored information.</li>
        <li><strong>Community Posts:</strong> Due to the decentralized nature of the P2P network, posts cannot be guaranteed to be deleted from all devices. However, you can delete posts from your local view.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>This app is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect information from children under 13. The Community Board feature is rated for users 12+ due to user-generated content.</p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>Your private signing key is stored securely on your device and is never transmitted. All posts are cryptographically signed to prevent impersonation.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new policy in the app.</p>

    <h2>Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have questions about this privacy policy, please contact us at: <a href="mailto:support@kwanzaa.app">support@kwanzaa.app</a></p>
